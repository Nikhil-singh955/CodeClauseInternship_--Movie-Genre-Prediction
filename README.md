🎥 Movie Genre Prediction 🎬
🚀 Project Aim
Predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary and other features using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project focuses on text classification to accurately determine movie genres from a dataset.

📝 Project Description
Ever wondered how streaming services recommend movies based on genres? 🎞️ Predicting genres from just a movie's plot can be challenging! This project tackles that challenge by using NLP techniques to analyze plot summaries and predict movie genres automatically.

Here's the flow:

📊 Data Collection: We start with a dataset containing movie plot summaries, genres, and other relevant features.
🔍 Text Preprocessing: Using NLP techniques (like tokenization, TF-IDF, etc.), we process the text.
🧠 Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms are trained to classify movie genres based on plot summaries.
🎯 Prediction: We predict the genres for the movies in the test dataset.
📁 Output: The predicted genres are saved in predicted_genres.csv.
🔑 Key Learnings
Throughout this project, we explored the following concepts:

Text Classification using NLP 📚
Feature Engineering for movie plot summaries ✍️
Training Machine Learning Models to handle textual data 🧠
Model Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score 📈
🛠️ Tech Stack
Here’s what we used to build this project:

Python 🐍: For building the predictive model
NLP Tools 📜: NLTK, spaCy, and other libraries for text preprocessing
Machine Learning Libraries 🤖: Scikit-learn for training classifiers
Pandas & NumPy 🧮: For data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊: For visualizing results
📂 Input & Output Files
train.csv: Training data containing movie plot summaries and genres
test.csv: Test data for generating predictions
predicted_genres.csv: The output file containing the predicted genres for each movie in the test dataset.
